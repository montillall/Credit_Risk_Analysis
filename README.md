# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview 

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, it is necessary to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. In order to do this analysis, it has been requested to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the analysis will include oversampling the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk and evaluate the performance of these models to recommend on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results

### Oversampling

#### Naive Random Ovesampling

* Results of the multiple linear regression analysis, show that 2 variables, vehicle_length and ground_clearence, are unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model, based on the p-value resulting < 0.05% (assumed significant level). This means that these 2 variables have a significant impact on the linear model therefore on the prediction of the mpg for the MechaCar prototypes.

* The p-value of the multiple linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our model is not zero.

* The R-squared of the model is 0.7149, which means that about 71% of the mpg (dependent variable) can be predicted by this linear model. Therefore, we can say that this model effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
 
### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The total summary statistics of the suspension coilâ€™s psi shows that for all manufacturing lots in total the design specification is met since the variance of the total data is 62.3 psi. See table below

The summary statistics by manufacturing lots shows that Lot1 and Lot2 meet the design specification (variance < 100 psi) while Lot3 does not meet design specification, variance is 170.3 psi.

### T-Tests on Suspension Coils

The T-test across all manufacturing lots shows that there is no statistical difference with respect to the population mean, the p-value is greater than assumed significance level (0.05), therefore doesn't support to reject the null hypothesis. See results below

![](Images/AllLots_Ttest.png)

The T-tests run for each Lot shows that for Lot1 and Lot2, there is no statistical difference with respect to the population mean, p-values are greater than assumed significance level (0.05), therefore doesn't support to reject the null hypothesis. See results below

On the other hand, for Lot3 the p-value (0.04168) is less than assumed significance level, which means there is statistical difference therefore supporting to reject the null hypothesis. See below

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

There are many things that can be compare when purchasing a car, one of those that buyers should consider when comparing cars would be safety systems. In order to study MechaCars vs competitors, one safety system could be air bags activation in collision. 

Null Hypothesis: MechaCars average air bag activation is similar to competitor vehicles.

Alternative Hypothesis: MechaCars average air bag activation is significantly different than competitor vehicles.

Statitstical test to use is two sample t-test

The data to collect would be mechaCar air bags tests and competitors actual data
